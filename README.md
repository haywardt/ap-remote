seatalk autopilot course change transmitter

This allows you to send course change commands from a rotary encoder to a seatalk listening autopilot. It requires only a 
single 2n2222 tranistor to interface to seatalk and only two pins for the rotary encoder. It should work with any arduino 
compatible computer.
